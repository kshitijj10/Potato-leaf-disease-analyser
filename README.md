Potato Disease Classification with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

This project aims to classify potato leaves into three categories: healthy, early blight, and late blight using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implemented in TensorFlow. The dataset contains images of potato leaves belonging to these categories. The model is trained, validated, and tested to achieve high accuracy in predicting the class of new images.



The following libraries are required to run this project:
TensorFlow
Matplotlib
IPython

## Training the Model

1. Download the data from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/arjuntejaswi/plant-village).
2. Only keep folders related to Potatoes.
